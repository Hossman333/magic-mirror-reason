## Magic Mirror Dashboard
Made with [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)
This is a much better version[MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror#modules)
I just made this to learn reason and to make a personalized dashboard for my smart mirror (:
I will be making it more generic though and adding features.
## Roadmap
- 1 quote per day(possibly refresh the page once a day.....since it already selects a random quote)
- Add weather support
- Weather forcast?
- Hackernews feed?
- Phone notifcations?
- Leap motion integration maybe?
- Smart mirror user interaction? Buttons, etc....
- ????
